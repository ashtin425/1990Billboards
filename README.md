# 1990Billboards
In this project I downloaded a dataset from kaggle containing the top 100 Billboard charts in the year 1990. My goal was to take a look at the data and see what songs from the data maintained relevance in modern times using the amount of streams each song has on Spotify as a guide. So firstly I created a SQL querie that rid itself of null values since im looking only at songs with calculated Spotify streams, and ordering the songs by the Spotify streams column in descending order. After getting that info, I wanted to see the songs with the most streams by genre. So I created a querie to grab the song with the most stream in each genre, and use the union function to stack each on top of eachother and order the table by Spotify streams in descending order. Also, looking at the subgenre section there are a lot of subgenres that don't exist in todays music scene so I did the same thing to the the subgenre category.
